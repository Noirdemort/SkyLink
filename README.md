# SkyLink - RAreNet (Router Area Network)

File-sharing and communication using routers and internet infrastructure in case when World Wide Web (what we basically know as internet) is inaccessible due to various reasons:
- disaster
- banned
- censorship, etc.


## TODO

    - Test the whole suite 
    - Add HTTPS & TLS Support 
    - Check compatibility with normal internet
    

## Future Extensions

    - Implement Tunneling and hiding network traffic
    - VPN protocols support
    - TOR integration (I really don't know what I am talking about)
